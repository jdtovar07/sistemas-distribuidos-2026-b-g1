# Week 10 — Persistence in Distributed Systems

**Topic:** Persistence in distributed systems — Saga, Outbox and CQRS
**Course:** Sistemas Distribuidos (2026-B, G1)

## Overview

Once each service owns its own data, the classic single-database transaction disappears. This week covers how to keep data reliable and consistent across many independent services, all under *eventual consistency*.

## 1. Database-per-Service

**What it is:** Each microservice owns and manages its own private database. Other services cannot read or write that database directly; they must go through the service's API.

**Why it matters:** It keeps services independent and loosely coupled, so a change in one service's data model does not break the others.

**Example:** In an online store, the Order Service, Inventory Service and Customer Service each have their own database.

## 2. Saga Pattern

**What it is:** A way to keep data consistent across services using a sequence of local transactions. If one step fails, compensating actions undo the previous steps.

**Why it matters:** There is no global transaction across services, so sagas provide consistency without locking everything together.

**Example:** Placing an order: reserve stock → charge payment → confirm order. If the payment fails, a compensating action releases the reserved stock.

## 3. Outbox Pattern

**What it is:** A technique to publish events reliably. The event is written to an "outbox" table inside the same local transaction as the business data, and a separate process later delivers it to the message broker.

**Why it matters:** It prevents the common bug where the database is updated but the event is lost (or the event is sent but the data was not saved).

**Example:** When an order is saved, an `OrderCreated` event is stored in the outbox in the same transaction, then delivered to other services.

## 4. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

**What it is:** Separating the write model (commands) from the read model (queries). Writes and reads use different, optimized models.

**Why it matters:** Reads can be served from a fast, denormalized store, improving performance and scalability.

**Example:** Orders are written to a normalized Write DB, while a separate Read DB is kept updated for fast dashboards and queries.

## 5. Eventual Consistency

**What it is:** Data across services becomes consistent over time, not instantly.

**Why it matters:** In distributed systems you trade immediate consistency for higher availability and scalability.

**Example:** After an order is placed, the reporting service may show it a few seconds later, once the event has propagated.
